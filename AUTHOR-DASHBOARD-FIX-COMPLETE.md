  total: dashboardStats?.terms?.total || userTerms.length,
  likes: dashboardStats?.likes?.received || 0,
  likesGiven: dashboardStats?.likes?.given || 0,
  reportsReceived: dashboardStats?.reports?.received || 0,
  totalActivities: dashboardStats?.activities?.total || calculated,
  commentsMade: dashboardStats?.comments?.made || 0,
  commentsReceived: dashboardStats?.comments?.received || 0,
};

// Real-time counts
const userComments = await fetchAuthorComments(user.id);
const likedTerms = await fetchLikedTerms();

const pendingValidationMods = await fetchPendingValidation();
