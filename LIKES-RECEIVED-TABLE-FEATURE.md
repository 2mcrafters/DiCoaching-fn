## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **Backend API Endpoint**

**New Endpoint:** `GET /api/user/received-likes`

**File:** `backend/routes/likes.js`

```javascript
router.get('/user/received-likes', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const userId = req.user && req.user.id;
    
    // Get all likes on terms authored by this user with user and term details
    const receivedLikes = await db.query(
      `SELECT 
        l.id as like_id,
        l.created_at as liked_at,
        l.user_id,
        u.name as user_name,
        u.firstname,
        u.lastname,
        u.email as user_email,
        u.profile_picture,
        u.role as user_role,
        t.id as term_id,
        t.terme as term_name,
        t.slug as term_slug,
        t.status as term_status
       FROM likes l
       INNER JOIN termes t ON l.term_id = t.id
       LEFT JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
       WHERE t.author_id = ?
       ORDER BY l.created_at DESC`,
      [userId]
    );
    
    res.json({ 
      status: 'success', 
      data: receivedLikes.map(like => ({
        id: like.like_id,
        likedAt: like.liked_at,
        user: {
          id: like.user_id,
          name: like.user_name || `${like.firstname || ''} ${like.lastname || ''}`.trim() || like.user_email || 'Utilisateur',
          email: like.user_email,
          profilePicture: like.profile_picture,
          role: like.user_role
        },
        term: {
          id: like.term_id,
          name: like.term_name,
          slug: like.term_slug,
          status: like.term_status
        }
      }))
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error fetching received likes:', err.message);
    res.status(500).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Erreur lors du chargement des likes reçus', error: err.message });
  }
});
```

**Query Details:**
- Joins `likes`, `termes`, and `users` tables
- Filters by author_id (current user)
- Returns user details (name, avatar, role)
- Returns term details (name, slug, status)
- Orders by most recent likes first

---

### 2. **Frontend API Service**

**File:** `src/services/api.js`

**New Method:**
```javascript
async getReceivedLikes() {
  const res = await this.get("/api/user/received-likes");
  return res?.data ?? res;
}
```

---

### 3. **Dashboard State Management**

**File:** `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`

#### **New State Variables:**
```javascript
const [receivedLikes, setReceivedLikes] = useState([]);
const [receivedLikesLoading, setReceivedLikesLoading] = useState(false);
const [receivedLikesPage, setReceivedLikesPage] = useState(1);
```

#### **Data Fetching Hook:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchReceivedLikes = async () => {
    if (!user?.id || (!isAuthor && user?.role !== "admin")) return;

    setReceivedLikesLoading(true);
    try {
      const apiService = await import("@/services/api");
      const data = await apiService.default.getReceivedLikes();
      console.log("💝 Received Likes Data:", data);
      const receivedLikesData = Array.isArray(data) ? data : [];
      setReceivedLikes(receivedLikesData);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("❌ Error fetching received likes:", error);
      setReceivedLikes([]);
    } finally {
      setReceivedLikesLoading(false);
    }
  };

  fetchReceivedLikes();
}, [user?.id, isAuthor]);
```

**When it runs:**
- Only for authors and admins
- Automatically on component mount
- Re-fetches when user changes

---

### 4. **Table UI Implementation**

#### **Loading State:**
```javascript
if (receivedLikesLoading) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground p-4">
      <Loader2 className="h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
      Chargement des likes reçus...
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **Empty State:**
```javascript
if (!receivedLikes || receivedLikes.length === 0) {
  return (
    <div className="text-center py-8 text-muted-foreground">
      <Heart className="h-12 w-12 mx-auto mb-4 opacity-30" />
      <p className="text-lg font-medium mb-2">Aucun like reçu</p>
      <p className="text-sm">
        Vos termes n'ont pas encore été aimés par d'autres utilisateurs.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **Data Table:**
```javascript
<table className="w-full border-collapse">
  <thead>
    <tr className="bg-muted/50">
      <th className="text-left p-3 font-semibold text-sm border-b">
        Utilisateur
      </th>
      <th className="text-left p-3 font-semold text-sm border-b">
        Terme
      </th>
      <th className="text-left p-3 font-semibold text-sm border-b">
        Date
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {paginatedReceivedLikes.map((like) => (
      <tr key={like.id} className="border-b hover:bg-muted/30 transition-colors">
        {/* User column with avatar and clickable name */}
        <td className="p-3">
          <Link to={`/author/${like.user.id}`} className="flex items-center gap-2 hover:text-primary transition-colors">
            <Avatar className="h-8 w-8">
              <AvatarImage src={like.user.profilePicture} />
              <AvatarFallback>
                {(like.user.name || "U").charAt(0).toUpperCase()}
              </AvatarFallback>
            </Avatar>
            <span className="font-medium">{like.user.name}</span>
          </Link>
        </td>
        
        {/* Term column with clickable link */}
        <td className="p-3">
          <Link to={`/fiche/${like.term.slug}`} className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">
            {like.term.name}
          </Link>
        </td>
        
        {/* Date column */}
        <td className="p-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          {new Date(like.likedAt).toLocaleDateString("fr-FR", {
            day: "2-digit",
            month: "short",
            year: "numeric",
          })}
        </td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

#### **Pagination:**
```javascript
{totalPagesReceivedLikes > 1 && (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 mt-4">
    <Button
      variant="outline"
      size="sm"
      onClick={() => setReceivedLikesPage((p) => Math.max(1, p - 1))}
      disabled={receivedLikesPage === 1}
    >
      Précédent
    </Button>
    <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      Page {receivedLikesPage} sur {totalPagesReceivedLikes}
    </span>
    <Button
      variant="outline"
      size="sm"
      onClick={() => setReceivedLikesPage((p) => Math.min(totalPagesReceivedLikes, p + 1))}
      disabled={receivedLikesPage === totalPagesReceivedLikes}
    >
      Suivant
    </Button>
  </div>
)}
```

## 📊 Data Structure

### **Received Like Object:**
```javascript
{
  id: 123,                    // Like ID
  likedAt: "2025-10-15T...",  // Timestamp
  user: {
    id: 45,                   // User ID
    name: "Jean Dupont",      // Display name
    email: "jean@example.com",
    profilePicture: "https://...",
    role: "chercheur"
  },
  term: {
    id: 78,                   // Term ID
    name: "Coaching",         // Term title
    slug: "coaching",         // URL slug
    status: "published"
  }
}
```
