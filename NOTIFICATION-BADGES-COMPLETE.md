# Dashboard & Admin Notification Badges Implementation

## Summary
Successfully added notification badges to all Dashboard tabs and Admin sections to show new items (within 24 hours).

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Author Tabs - Notification Badges Added

#### **Commentaires (Comments)**
- ✅ Already had notifications
- Shows: New comments on author's terms (last 24 hours)
- Badge: Red circle with count

#### **Termes aimés (Liked Terms)**
- ✨ NEW: Added notification for newly liked terms
- Shows: Terms liked in last 24 hours
- Logic: Filters by `likedAt` or `liked_at` field

#### **Mes termes (My Terms)**
- ✨ NEW: Added notification for newly created terms
- Shows: Terms created in last 24 hours
- Logic: Filters by `created_at` or `createdAt` field
- **Important**: With 1421 total terms, this helps authors see their latest additions

#### **Signalements (Reports Received)**
- ✨ NEW: Added notification for new reports on author's terms
- Shows: Reports received in last 24 hours
- Logic: Filters by `created_at` or `createdAt` field

### 2. Dashboard Researcher Tabs - Notification Badges Added

#### **Termes appréciés (Liked Terms)**
- ✨ NEW: Added notification for newly liked terms
- Shows: Terms liked in last 24 hours
- Same logic as author tab

#### **Modifications proposées (Proposed Modifications)**
- ✨ NEW: Added notification for newly proposed modifications
- Shows: Modifications created in last 24 hours
- Logic: Filters researcher's modifications by `created_at` or `createdAt`

#### **Signalements effectués (Reports Made)**

- Shows: Reports created by user in last 24 hours
- Logic: Filters user's reports by `created_at` or `createdAt`

#### **Activités totales (Total Activities)**
- No badge (shows overall statistics)

### 3. Admin Tabs - Already Have Notifications

The Admin page already had notification badges working:
- ✅ **Auteurs en attente**: Shows pending author count
- ✅ **Modifications**: Shows pending modifications count
- ✅ **Signalements**: Shows pending reports count
- ✅ **Gestion des termes**: No badge (management interface)
- ✅ **Catégories**: No badge (management interface)
- ✅ **Gestion des utilisateurs**: No badge (management interface)

## Technical Implementation

### New State Variables
```javascript
const [newReceivedReportsCount, setNewReceivedReportsCount] = useState(0);
const [newLikedTermsCount, setNewLikedTermsCount] = useState(0);
const [newUserTermsCount, setNewUserTermsCount] = useState(0);
const [newUserReportsCount, setNewUserReportsCount] = useState(0);
const [newModificationsCount, setNewModificationsCount] = useState(0);
```

### Calculation Logic (Example)
```javascript
// Calculate new items (last 24 hours)
const oneDayAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
const newItems = items.filter((item) => {
  const itemDate = new Date(item.created_at || item.createdAt);
  return itemDate > oneDayAgo;
});
setNewItemsCount(newItems.length);
```

### Badge Display (Already Implemented)
```javascript
{tab.badge && tab.badge > 0 && (
  <span className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 inline-flex items-center justify-center px-1.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-bold leading-none text-white transform bg-red-500 rounded-full min-w-[1.25rem]">
    {tab.badge}
  </span>
)}
```

## Where Notifications Are Calculated

### 1. **Comments** (already existed)
- Location: `useEffect` for `fetchUserComments`
- Field: `comment.createdAt`
- Condition: `commentDate > oneDayAgo`

### 2. **Liked Terms**
- Location: `useEffect` for `fetchLikedTerms`
- Field: `term.likedAt` or `term.liked_at`
- Condition: `likedDate > oneDayAgo`

### 3. **User Terms**
- Location: `useEffect` after `userTerms` memo
- Field: `term.created_at` or `term.createdAt`
- Condition: `createdDate > oneDayAgo`

### 4. **Received Reports** (on author's terms)
- Location: `useEffect` for `fetchReceivedReports`
- Field: `report.created_at` or `report.createdAt`
- Condition: `reportDate > oneDayAgo`

### 5. **User Reports** (made by researcher)
- Location: `useEffect` for `fetchUserReports`
- Field: `report.created_at` or `report.createdAt`
- Condition: `reportDate > oneDayAgo`

### 6. **Modifications**
- Location: `useEffect` after `researcherModifications` memo
- Field: `mod.created_at` or `mod.createdAt`
- Condition: `createdDate > oneDayAgo`

## Notification Behavior

### What Shows in Badges?
- **Only NEW items** (within last 24 hours)
- **NOT total counts** (which would be overwhelming for 1421 terms!)
- **Red badge** appears on top-right of tab button

### When Do Badges Update?
- On page load/refresh
- When user performs actions (like, create, report)
- When switching tabs (data refetches)

### Visual Design
- Position: Absolute top-right corner of tab button
- Color: Red background (`bg-red-500`)
- Text: White, bold, small font
- Shape: Circular with min-width
- Animation: Smooth appearance

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Clear Visual Feedback**
   - Users immediately see new activity
   - No need to click each tab to check

2. **Prioritization**
   - Red badges draw attention to urgent items
   - Empty badges (no new items) keep UI clean

3. **Activity Tracking**
   - Authors see new comments on their terms instantly
   - Researchers track their modification submissions
   - Everyone sees recent likes and reports

4. **Reduced Overwhelm**
   - Shows only last 24 hours, not all-time totals
   - Keeps notifications manageable and relevant

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios

1. **Fresh Content**
   - Create a new term → Check "Mes termes" badge appears
   - Like a term → Check "Termes aimés" badge appears
   - Submit a report → Check "Signalements" badge appears

2. **Old Content**
   - Content older than 24 hours should NOT show badge
   - Total items still visible in tab content
   - Only badge counts recent items

3. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Perform action → Badge should update immediately
   - Refresh page → Badge should persist
   - Wait 24 hours → Badge should disappear for old items

4. **Multiple Roles**
   - Test as Author → See Commentaires, Termes aimés, Mes termes, Signalements badges
   - Test as Researcher → See Termes appréciés, Modifications, Signalements badges
   - Test as Admin → See all admin panel badges

## Files Modified

1. `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
   - Added 5 new state variables for notification counts
   - Added calculation logic in 6 different useEffect/useMemo hooks
   - Updated `authorTabs` to use new counts
   - Updated `researcherTabs` to use new counts

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing functionality preserved
- Tab display logic unchanged
- Badge rendering already existed (just added new data)
- Pagination unaffected
- API calls remain the same

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Persistent Read Status**
   - Store "last viewed" timestamp in localStorage
   - Show badge until user views the tab
   - Reset on tab click

2. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Use WebSockets or polling
   - Update badges without page refresh
   - Show live notifications

3. **Sound/Desktop Notifications**
   - Browser notifications for new comments
   - Sound alerts for important updates
   - Opt-in notification preferences

4. **Badge Animation**
   - Pulse effect for new notifications
   - Bounce animation on update
   - Fade in/out transitions

5. **Detailed Breakdown**
   - Tooltip showing what's new
   - "3 new comments, 2 new likes"
   - Quick preview on hover
